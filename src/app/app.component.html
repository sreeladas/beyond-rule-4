            <h5>About</h5>
            <p>
              This application is an open source side-project of a software
              developer chasing financial freedom. It is a minor modification on
              a fork of
              <a href="https://beyondrule4.jmmorrissey.com">Beyond Rule 4</a>
              and was created to provide motivation and clarity on a path to
              financially independence.
            </p>

            <p>
              This application doesn't collect or store any personal data before
              or after authorizing with YNAB. It may use browser cookies for
              browser-local session storage and essential application
              functionality (storing your YNAB authorization token) but does not
              use any analytics or tracking.
            </p>

            <p>
              When the app authorizes with YNAB, it requests read-only access.
              It does not and cannot add or edit any information to your account
              or budget.
            </p>

            <p>
              To revoke authorization at any time, visit
              <a href="https://app.ynab.com/settings" target="_blank"
                >https://app.ynab.com/settings</a
              >, scroll to "Authorized Applications", and click "Revoke" for
              YFI. Thanks for trying it out!
